# Basic Electronic Structure Calculations with Silicon
We begin learning the basics of DFT calculations via quantum espresso with the simple case of silicon. 
In particular, we get acquainted with the input file and shell scripts that allow for generation of input files, performing
calculations and writing data out to a datafile for plotting. 

This follows the material-for-ljubljana-qe-summer-school Day 1 work. 

Things we calculate here
- Energy as a function of lattice constant a to determine the lattice constant that minimizes E
