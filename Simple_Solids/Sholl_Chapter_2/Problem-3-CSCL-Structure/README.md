# Sholl Ch2. Problem 3

A large number of solids with stoichiometry AB form the CsCl structure. In this structure, atoms of A define a simple cubic structure and atoms of B reside in the center of each cube of A atoms. Define the cell vectors
and fractional coordinates for the CsCl structure, then use this structure to predict the lattice constant of ScAl.
